## 📋 Pre-Push Actions

Before running `git push`:

```bash
# 1. Verify no secrets exposed
grep -r "API_KEY\|SECRET\|PASSWORD" backend/src frontend/src
# Should return nothing

# 2. Check .env not committed
git status | grep ".env"
# Should show nothing

# 3. Audit dependencies
cd backend && npm audit
cd ../frontend && npm audit
# Should show 0 vulnerabilities

# 4. Build frontend
cd frontend && npm run build
# Should complete without errors

# 5. Build backend
cd backend && npm run build
# Should complete without errors

# 6. Test Docker build
docker build -t flux-atlas-test .
# Should complete successfully

# 7. Test Docker run
docker run -d -p 3001:3000 -p 4001:4000 --name flux-atlas-test flux-atlas-test
# Wait 10 seconds
curl http://localhost:4001/healthz
# Should return JSON

# 8. Clean up test
docker stop flux-atlas-test
docker rm flux-atlas-test
```

## 📋 Post-Push Actions

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Verify Repository**
   - [ ] README displays correctly
   - [ ] All links work
   - [ ] Images/logos visible
   - [ ] Code syntax highlighting works

2. **GitHub Settings**
   - [ ] Repository description set
   - [ ] Topics added (flux, blockchain, visualization, react, typescript)
   - [ ] Website URL added
   - [ ] Issues enabled
   - [ ] Wiki disabled (or configured)
   - [ ] Discussions optional

3. **GitHub Actions** (Optional)
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
   - [ ] Automated tests
   - [ ] Docker image build
   - [ ] Security scanning

## 📋 Flux Deployment

Before deploying to Flux marketplace:

1. **Docker Registry**
   - [ ] Image pushed to Docker Hub
   - [ ] Image tagged with version
   - [ ] Image publicly accessible
   - [ ] Image size reasonable (<500MB)

2. **Flux Specification**
   - [ ] CPU requirements set (2 cores recommended)
   - [ ] RAM requirements set (4GB recommended)
   - [ ] Storage requirements set (10GB)
   - [ ] Ports configured (3000, 4000)
   - [ ] Environment variables set
   - [ ] Health check configured

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Deploy to test Flux node first
   - [ ] Verify health check works
   - [ ] Verify frontend accessible
   - [ ] Verify API accessible
   - [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

## ⚠️ Known Issues

Document any known issues or limitations:

- **Initial Build Time**: First network scan takes 6-7 minutes
  - *Expected behavior*: Wait for "Rebuild Complete" notification

- **Memory Usage**: Can reach 400MB during network scans
  - *Solution*: Ensure Flux node has sufficient RAM

- **Rate Limiting**: Heavy usage may hit rate limits
  - *Solution*: 100 req/min is typically sufficient
